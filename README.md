# Flight Price Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting flight prices based on various features using machine learning. The dataset used for this project is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhambathwal/flight-price-prediction).

## Project Structure

- **Flight_Price_Prediction.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning model building.
- **Flight_Price_Prediction_model.pkl**: Pickle file containing the trained machine learning model.
- **README.md**: Project documentation and information.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Flight-Price-Prediction.git
## Model Evaluation

The project utilizes Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Ridge Regression models. Model performance metrics and hyperparameter tuning results can be found in the `Flight_Price_Prediction.ipynb` notebook.
